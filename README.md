There are sum, deduct, multiply, divide buttons. This buttons write the calculator symbols which on the button. User should click the 'CALCULATE' button for taking result of calculation. If user wants to delete all numbers on the calculation, should click the 'C' button. If user wants to delete just one number, should click the 'DEL' button.
